Calculate the sum of 'value' of nested nodes in the same indent level with the same parent, 
if “isprobability” is true, and writes the total into a new key 'total'. It then adds this 
sum to a new ‘total’ field in each node and writes the updated JSON data back to the file.

!!!LIST OF BUGS TO BE FIXED:
- not all nested values are calculated probabilities
