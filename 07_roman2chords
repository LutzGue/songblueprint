In this function, the Roman numerals in the generated JSON are mapped to the corresponding chord names. This mapping is done backwards, because the key changes of cadences and mini-cadences have to be taken into account. The inversions are also indicated accordingly in the chord name. There are two ways of representing this: (1) as bass note with slash symbol or (2) with additional "a", "b", "c" suffixes. Additionally, the parsetree syntax is extended with the chord names and marked in color as the last node in the diagram, so that the layout is aligned at the bottom of the diagram.
