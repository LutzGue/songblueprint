# songblueprint
A Python module that generates songs from chord progressions and song structures based on tonal harmony in twentieth-century music. You can create and practice your own musical compositions by using a machine-readable language that represents the prototype of the song structure. Probabilities are used in a blueprint to determine the chords and the song structure that best suit your style and mood. It's an innovative and creative tool for anyone who loves music and programming.

## parser
- convert manual txt input using tab for hierarchie into nested dictionary
- handle multiple levels of hierarchy
- count the leading spaces (or TAB characters) and determine the indentation level

## Example
### Input (TXT-file)
cadV
    cadV_type1, 10
        V
            46
        V
            35
    cadV_type2, 10
        V
            46
        V
            357
### Result (nested dictionary in py)
{
    'cadV': {
        'cadV_type1': {
            'value': '10',
            'V46': {},
            'V35': {}
        },
        'cadV_type2': {
            'value': '10',
            'V46': {},
            'V357': {}
        }
    }
