# songblueprint
A Python module that generates songs from chord progressions and song structures based on tonal harmony in twentieth-century music. You can create and practice your own musical compositions by using a machine-readable language that represents the prototype of the song structure. Probabilities are used in a blueprint to determine the chords and the song structure that best suit your style and mood. It's an innovative and creative tool for anyone who loves music and programming.
